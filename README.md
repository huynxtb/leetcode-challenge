# LeetCode Solutions in C#

  A minimal, reference-only collection of **LeetCode** solutions implemented in **C#**.  
  This repository focuses on clean, per-problem organization and short explanations.  
  It is **not an executable app** and does **not** include local build/run setup.

Each problem folder contains:
- **Solution**: `<slug>.cs` (with a `public class Solution` as per LeetCode)
- **Explanation**: `README.md` (brief idea, complexity, sample cases)

## Notes
- Code targets LeetCode’s online judge environment.
- No local run/test instructions are provided in this repo.
- Naming style: `PascalCase` for classes/methods, `camelCase` for variables.
