# Zigzag Conversion\n*   **Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/\n*   **Difficulty:** Medium\n*   **Question:** Zigzag Conversion\n\n## Algorithm Explanation\nThe problem requires rearranging a given string in a "zigzag" pattern based on the specified number of rows, then reading the zigzag pattern line by line to create a new string.\n\nTo solve this, we simulate the zigzag traversal: use an array (or list) of StringBuilders, each corresponding to a row. We iterate through the original string character by character, appending each character to the appropriate row's StringBuilder. We move "down" through the rows until we reach the last row, then move "up" until we reach the top row, and repeat. We maintain a variable `currentRow` and a boolean `goingDown` to track this traversal.\n\nFinally, we concatenate all row strings to form the final converted output.\n\n### Key points:\n- If `numRows` is 1 or greater than or equal to the string length, the output is the original string (no zigzag shape possible).\n- We use an efficient StringBuilder per row to avoid string concatenation overhead.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe solution involves iterating through the input string once, O(n), where n is the length of the string. Concatenating the rows is also O(n). Overall time complexity is O(n).\n\n### Space Complexity\nWe use additional space for the StringBuilders corresponding to each row, in total O(n) space (the sum of all characters is the input length). Temporary variables use O(1) space.\n
